# wolfcam
Arduino based camera controller for Wolf exhibit at the Museum of Life and Science

The WolfCam has three cameras, of which two are moveable and one is fixed. 
Only one of the moveable cameras can be controlled, by pressing number 1 and moving the joystick. 
The second moveable camera cannot be controlled but we will soon try to add it to the code. 
The Dan camera is the one that cannot be moved, so it just stays put at where the wolfs sleep. 
Inside the pannel there are a lot of wires, and we will try to make it simpler and remove some of them.
When the camera 1 is selected, sometimes there is a problem with the wires and they stay activated, making it possible to only move it up and right. 
The pannig is proporcional to the zoom, so if you have the greater amount of zoom selected, it will pan slower, making it easier to visitors to use the camera.
There is also a thermometer inside the box that is connected with the fan and activates it when it's hot.
